## Instructions for use
- **Click the ‚ÄúPlay/Stop Music‚Äù button** in the top-left corner to start or stop the music.
- When the music plays:
  - **Particles automatically generate and respond to music amplitude** (volume level)
  - **Particle speed, size, and quantity** dynamically change with the rhythm
  - You can also **click the mouse** to manually create particles at that position
- When the music stops:
  - Existing particles **gracefully fade out** and no new particles are generated

## Details about My Personal Approach to the Animation Group Code

I chose **audio** as the driving force for my individual animation contribution.

The **background portion** of the image is animated, and the particles within that layer **respond dynamically to the loudness of the music**:

- üéµ The **movement speed** of particles increases as the volume rises
- üéµ The **size** of particles scales proportionally with amplitude
- üéµ The **number of particles** automatically generated during each audio burst is based on the real-time volume level

The **visual effects** of particle trajectories are animated using `p5.Vector`, with `HSB` color mode enabled for vibrant color transitions:

- The **transparency (alpha)** of each trail point gradually fades, creating a **motion blur effect**
- Particles achieve **unique and natural movement** by combining amplitude-driven **motion speed** and **density control**

## Inspiration
- The visual inspiration partly comes from the following two works on openprocessing:
  - https://openprocessing.org/sketch/751983 ‚Äî Inspired by the flow and blurred trail effect of dynamic particles
  - https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2666260 ‚Äî Inspired my design of audio-triggered particle density and movement rhythm

## Technical explanation
I only modified the background part of the original code to enhance the interactive effect between music and vision in the following ways:

 - Added spectrum analysis background animation:

 - Use p5.FFT() to obtain the frequency data of the currently playing music.

  - Analyze the bass (low frequency), mid (intermediate frequency), and treble (high frequency) energy values ‚Äã‚Äãand map them to the RGB color of the background particles.

 - Use the map() function to control the change of particle size according to the overall volume level to form a visual "jumping" effect.

**Movement mechanism of background particles**

 - Each particle has a direction vector (p5.Vector.random2D()) and moves continuously in the canvas.

 - If the particle leaves the canvas boundary, it is reset to a random position to achieve continuous dynamic flow.

**ÔºàThis part of the function is not included in the original course code and is my expansion of the project.Ôºâ**
