# Music Particles Fade — Creative Coding Major Project


## Instructions for use
- **Click the “Play/Stop Music” button** in the top-left corner to start or stop the music.
- When the music plays:
  - **Particles automatically generate and respond to music amplitude** (volume level)
  - **Particle speed, size, and quantity** dynamically change with the rhythm
  - You can also **click the mouse** to manually create particles at that position
- When the music stops:
  - Existing particles **gracefully fade out** and no new particles are generated
